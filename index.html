My research interests are the mathematical aspects of coding theory, cryptography and information theory, especially their connections with geometry and abstract algebra.

I completed my PhD at the UWA <a href="https://www.cmsc.io/">Centre for Mathematics of Symmetry and Computation</a> under John Bamberg, Alice Devillers and Cheryl Praeger. My thesis is titled "Codes in Johnson graphs associated with quadratic forms over GF(2)". My honours project was also completed at UWA under John Bamberg. My honours project uses permutation group methods to analyse the action of the three strand braid group on rational tangles.
